# Installing game engine

First, clone the project directory using `git clone git@github.com:Al1002/game_engine.git`.

### On linux

Install the dependencies by running `install_dependencies.sh`

Then, run `cmake_build_alias.sh` to run CMake and build the project.

Currently, there is no way to install the package besides using the raw `libengine.a` archive/library.

Instead, run `exec_env/main`, generated from the `src/main.cpp` file.

### On windows

No installation instruction exist for windows as of now.
